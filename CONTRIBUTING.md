# How to contribute
In order to even affect another person's).
repo, you need to be a contributor. In order for this to happen the person has to [invite](https://help.github.com/articles/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository/) you to be one and you must accept it by going to your [notifications page](https://github.com/notifications?all=1).
Alternatively, you can check your email for a link to accept the invitation.
Once you're a contributor, you will be able to affect the contents of a repo.

#### When to upload a file
Really whenever the hell you want, as long as having it in the repo doesn't break anything.
Standard code sharing rules apply (what we did with googledrive).
Remember when you upload your code to give it a title and label!

#### When to make a branch
You should make a new branch when you're adding a new feature that involves pre-existing files.
For example, adding a clear line method in a repo that has the rest of the tetris code would call for this.
You can compare the differences between the same files in two different branches to account for other people changing code, this is not an issue.
If you feel unsure about correctly merging branches, make an issue asking someone else to do it.

#### When to fork
I can't think of a relevant way forking can be used when you can just make a new branch.
This is because forking allows for one to use another's code as a jumping off point or for one to freely change another's code without affecting the source.
Since this is a group project, where ever jumping off points lead to, they either end up being added or scrapped. At that point you're just changing code without affecting the source.
Therefore use branches (if anyone disagrees feel free to edit!).

#### When to make an issue
As the definition says:
> An issue can be a bug report, a request for a new feature, a request for help or even a question.

Be sure to add a label going into detail of what your issue is. And remember, green means open and red means closed.

#### When to make pull requests
When you want others to review your code before submission. You can also make a pull request when you're unsure about merging and want someone else to merge the branches without ruining everything.

#### When to make a release
Releases aren't particularly relevant to our project and I'd suggest not using them as this will be over in three weeks rather than being a long-term, ongoing project.
