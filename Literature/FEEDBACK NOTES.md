## Report Feedback (Pietro and Computer Science guy)

### Introduction

- Talk about the four assignments
- Talk about our approaches to solving them
- Talk about what the rest of the report consists of

### Section 2

- General naming issue --> restructure to have a smooth flow from topic to topic:
  1. Implementation
  2. Experimentation
  3. Conclusion

#### Implementation

- UMC (Class) diagram
- Psuedo-code or flowchart (preferable one or the other)
- What we've implemented and why
- How to use the code we've produced (GUI)
- Explicitly mention that we made the 3D animation from scratch

#### Experimentation

- Explain our code, what we hope it does, and how we tested our code to make sure it was robust
- How to reproduce the results of our experiments
- Organise the experiments for clear one-to-one mapping with results
- Be selective about what visual aids to use in the main code, surplus content can go to the appendix

#### Conclusion

- Best results for the experiments (clear linkage, one-to-one)
- Conclusions about our algorithms (what we learned from experimenting hence why we did what we did in our code)
- Conclude the assignment based on our conclusion for the algorithms

## Presentation Advice

- The presentation to our project is the trailer to a movie, a highlight reel
- Sell that our code is good and that it works well
- Use the slides to support what we are **saying** (people can either look or listen)
- 1 slide ~ 1 minute
- Presentation should last around 17-20 minutes, with the total timeslot lasting 25 minutes
- Prepare answers to questions after the presentation to demonstrate forsight

## Presentation Feedback (Sarah the Grammar lady)

- Preferred introduction structure:
  1. Background information on the problem and defining keywords
  2. Explain what problems we wish to solve
  3. What the rest of the presentation will be about
  
- Solidfy speaking order
- Give everyone a significant speaking role
- Practice using formal language i.e. avoid using "like" and "so"
- Have explainations be consistently detailed

#### Upper band requirements for presentation

- Show applications of the topic in a timely manner
- Involve the audience: interest applications or facts, humour, rhetorical questions
- Presentation is tailored to its intended purpose for its target audience
- Good speach, timing, tone and body language
- Correct pronunciation and innotation (the change of pitch when a person speaks, don't raise your pitch like you're asking a question unless you are)
- Variety of speach patterns with appropriate vocabulary that are grammatically correct
- Only look at the presentation screen when necessary
- Visual aids reinforce what is being said and made the presentation more impactful rather than act as a distractor
- Content is clear and concise with keypoint emphasised
- Answers questions post-presentation easily, demonstrating good knowledge and correct, fluent language
